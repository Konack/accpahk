# accpahk
Exp Branch is for experimental builds of the scripts. Theses builds are meant for future plans of Accpahk and gives a snapshot of what the final prduct will turn into.
Scripts used for easier execution of task while using VisionPoint 10.0. 
These scripts are specialized towards the workflow and setup specific to my requirements. 
If you wish to reuse these and need assistance with adopting them I am willing to assist.
All scripts are created with AHK and can be downloaded from https://autohotkey.com/.
